# Hi, I'm Pezhman Tajik 👋
🖥️ I'm a software developer primarily skilled in C#, with considerable knowledge in React.js, and some understanding of Python.  
🏗️ I'm developing the backend for an e-commerce project, with plans to add the React.js frontend to GitHub soon.  
🤖 I love learning about AI and ML, diving into the basics and exploring their applications in my free time.  
📚 I’m also keen on enhancing my skills in software development and considering opportunities as a software developer.
